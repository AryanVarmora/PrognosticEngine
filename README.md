# PrognosticEngine

# Overview

PrognosticEngine is a predictive maintenance system designed to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment based on sensor data. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and real-time data analytics, this tool enables proactive maintenance strategies to prevent unexpected breakdowns, optimize operational efficiency, and reduce costs.

# Features

RUL Prediction: Accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life of machines using regression and deep learning models.

Anomaly Detection: Identify abnormal patterns and outliers in sensor data to anticipate potential issues.

Visual Dashboards: Interactive and user-friendly dashboards for monitoring machine health and predictions.

Customizable Workflows: Modular design to adapt to various industries and use cases.

Scalable Architecture: Capable of handling large datasets and supporting real-time predictions with distributed systems.

# Dataset

This project uses the CMAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset provided by NASA, which simulates degradation data for aircraft engines. It includes time-series sensor readings for multiple engines operating under various conditions.

## Dataset Components

Training Data: Contains time-series sensor data for engines until they fail:

train_FD001.txt, train_FD002.txt, etc.

Test Data: Includes time-series data for engines up to a certain time point (without failure):

test_FD001.txt, test_FD002.txt, etc.

RUL Files: Provides the true Remaining Useful Life values for the test engines:

RUL_FD001.txt, RUL_FD002.txt, etc.

For more details, refer to the readme.txt and Damage Propagation Modeling.pdf included with the dataset.

streamlit run visuals/dashboard.py

# Example Workflow

### 1. Load and preprocess the CMAPSS dataset.

### 2. Train a baseline model (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) to predict RUL.

### 3. Experiment with advanced models like LSTMs or GRUs for time-series analysis.

### 4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE or MAE.

### 4. Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
